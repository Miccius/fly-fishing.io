           How to begin 
        </h3>
          <p>Learning about <em><a href="https://blueridgemountainlife.com/what-is-fly-fishing/">FLY FISCHING</a></em> can be a little overwhelming at first, as there are lots of new terms, the gear is real different than traditional fishing, and casting ... well it's not difficult, but getting it right takes lots of practice.
           Unfortunately, many beginners get overwhelmed by the fly fishing basics, and decide to just not start at all, which is really unfortunate.  Fly Fishing is certainly not a sport you can just jump into one day, and you're coming home with loads of Rainbow Trout that evening.  You'll spend a few trips getting to know your gear, and learning how to cast properly, along with learning how  to find the right spots.
           Of course, heading out with an experienced fly fisher or using a professional fly fishing guide is the fastest way to learn, and if you have the money, a really great investment.
           The bottom line is that fly fishing is all about enjoying the experience and becoming one with nature.   Take your time, don't pressure yourself, and enjoy the journey of learning.   Fly fishing for beginners can be an experience of a lifetime if you just give it a chance.</p>

       <p>  The first thing you'll need to take care of is getting all the necessary 
            basic <em><a href="https://www.epicflyrods.com/en-eu?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=18069043880&utm_content=145384752172&utm_term=&gadid=616773031864&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyMKbBhD1ARIsANs7rEF91sfclKoNO13fGmRAIUOW9f3HwoVTzYS0JXrR-eeTONyIfraOgSoaAppdEALw_wcB">FLY FISHING EQUIPMENT</a></em> fishing equipment.   When we say basic, we mean the gear that you 
            absolutely need to get out there and start fishing.  The various fly fishing 
            vendors carry lots of fly fishing gear, and while many of these items are really 
            nice, they aren't needed. 
        </p>

        <h4>What basic gear do you need?  You'll need:</h4>
<br>
        <ul>
            <li>A fly rod</li>
            <li>A fly reel</li>
            <li>Fly fishing line, which consists of: backing, fly line, a leader, and a tippet.  Don't worry, we'll explain all of this in a bit.</li>
            <li>A few flies of course, hard to fly fish without flies!</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <p>That's it.  Many of the popular fly gear companies offer packages, 
            that come with everything you need.  

            I want to touch a bit on each piece of equipment, and how to go about
             selecting decent gear.  Far too many fly fishing beginners don't want to
              put much money into the hobby at first, which we understand.  The problem is when people buy cheap 
              fly fishing gear, they get frustrated because it breaks or doesn't perform well.  Gear can be the deciding factor on whether someone continues fly fishing or quits.
            
            Fortunately, there are lots of manufacturers making really good quality gear at reasonable prices.</p>

     <p>These two fly fishing gear items are the most important.  They are the basis for all your other gear. 
         Fly rods range in price from around $50 to well over $1000.  The prices vary based on the material the rod is made from, and the quality of it's construction.

        Fly rod's also come in different weights and lengths.  
        The rod you need, depends on the type of fishing you'll be doing.   We recommend a graphite fly 
        rod, in the medium price range.
        
        As with fly rods, fly reel prices vary as well.  On the low end are plastic reels.  While inexpensive, we recommend you stay away from these.  They don't perform well, break easily, and don't last.   You want a metal fly reel.
        
        One important thing when purchasing a rod and reel, is they must be matched.  Meaning the Rod's weight must be matched to the reel in order to perform properly.
        
        Tip: Fly rods and reels are available as combinations from most manufacturers.  If you buy them together, they are matched already AND you get a discount.  Definitely the best way to to buy.</p>

    <h3>
        fly backing, fly line, tippet and leader 
     </h3>
     
     <p>Fly Backing is used to fill up the reel (called the Arbor).  Backing is primarily used to provide extra length for a longer fish run.  Backing is often thick, and brightly colored to make it easy to see on the water.  The backing is the longest portion of the line.

        Fly Line provides the weight when fly fishing.  The line is heavy and and generally brightly colored.
        
        The Leader is used to transition from the thick fly line to the thin Tippet.  The leader starts thick, to match the fly line, but then tapers down to a much smaller size.  The leader's purpose is to keep the heavier fly line from "slapping" onto the water, and scaring the fish.  It also serves to as a nearly invisible transition to the tippet and fly.  This keeps the overall fly line from being seen by the fish.  Leaders are generally about 9 - 10 feet.
        
         The Tippet attaches the fly to the leader.  The tippet attaches to the fly at one end, to the leader on the other and is nearly invisible in the water.  This allows the fly to be presented without any line at all being seen by the fish.  The trick is finding the strongest, yet hardest to see tippet.
        
        As you shop around for these items, you'll notice that they all come in many different sizes.  The "right" size depends on your rod, and the type of fishing you will be doing.  Assuming you purchase the general use Rod/Reel combination we recommended, you don't have to worry about all this, as it comes ready to fish.</p>

               flies 
             </h3>
             
             <p>
                Now that we know the basics of the whole fly line, let's talk a little about the fly, the real bait in a fly fishing set-up.  There are three primary types of flies:

               Dry Flies are the most common, and are designed to look like flying insects that land and float on top of the water.

               Nymphs resemble aquatic creatures, often larvae, and generally float at or just below the surface.

              Streamers are designed to mimc aquatic life as well, but larger than nymphs, typically leeches.  Streamers are also referred to as lures.

              To determine the best type of fly to use, consult with a local fishing shop or fishing expert.  They'll know what works best in your area, and for the type of fish you're after.  Flies can be purchased with either barbed or barbless hooks.  We prefer barbless, but both have their sets of pros and cons.
